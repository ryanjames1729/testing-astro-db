# Astro DB

## About
This project is a simple Astro project that I am using to learn how their new Astro DB works. I am only using Astro in my tech stack for this. I did deploy this with Netlify to see how the DB would work in the cloud versus only serving up local data from my machine. You can read about my progress in building this repo on [dev.to](https://dev.to/ryanjames1729/learning-with-astrodb-25og)
